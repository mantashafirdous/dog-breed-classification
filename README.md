# Dog Breed Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify dog breeds from images. The notebook leverages pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fine-tunes them to achieve accurate predictions on a diverse dataset of dog images.

## Features
- **Pre-trained Model**: Utilizes transfer learning with a state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applies transformations like rotation, flipping, and scaling to enhance model generalization.
- **Multi-class Classification**: Predicts from a wide range of dog breeds.

## Dataset
The dataset contains labeled images of various dog breeds. It is split into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

### Dataset Structure:
- **Training Set**: Used to train the model.
- **Validation Set**: Used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
- **Test Set**: Used to evaluate the final model's accuracy.

## Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you need the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Steps in the Notebook
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load images and labels.
   - Resize images to a uniform size.
   - Normalize pixel values.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Use a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet, Inception) as the base model.
   - Add custom dense layers for classification.

3. **Training**:
   - Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
   - Train the model using the training data and validate it on the validation set.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
   - Generate metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Predict dog breeds for new images.
   - Visualize predictions with confidence scores.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set.
- **Loss**: Training and validation loss curves demonstrate effective learning.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd dog-breed-classification
   ```
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
